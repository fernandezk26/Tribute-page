					<p class="text-body">We have all heard about the summer of '69. This was a very dynamic time. It was a time of war, a time of peace, or the longing for it, a time of love, experimenting and questioning. Why was this such a crazy time? The answer lies in many different places, but one of the main driving forces was <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lysergic_acid_diethylamide">Lysergic Acid Diethylamide</a>, or LSD. LSD is a psychedelic drug that has been known to cause hallucinations, synesthesia, spiritual and religious experiences along with many other adverse effects. It was and still is a popular drug for youth do to its ability to change ones perception in an enormous way, whether for the better or worse. This page is not just about LSD though, it is about the man who invented it, Albert Hoffman.</p>
