			<p class="text-body preface">We have all heard about the summer of '69. This was a very dynamic time. It was a time of war, a time of peace, or the longing for it, a time of love, experimenting and questioning. Why was this such a crazy time? The answer lies in many different places, but one of the main driving foures was Lysergic Acid Diethylamide, or LSD. LSD is a psychedelic drug that has been known to cause hallucinations, synesthesia, spiritual and religious experiences along with many other adverse effects. This page is not about LSD though, it is about the man who invented it, Albert Hoffman.</p>
